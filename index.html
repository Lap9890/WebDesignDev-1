<h3>This website covers the UN goal number 14 on the "17 Goals to Transform Our World", which is Life Below Water.</h3>
<p>This goal talks about marine life, oceans and the seas We need the oceans to be clean and healthy to exist. It is the key element in the existance of life. Most of the earth is water 75% in fact. The oceans do a lot for us that we take for granted.</p>
<p>It provides natural resources such as food, medicines, fuels and it aborbs C02 from the atmosphere. Yet, we still pollute it causing the PH to become more acidic. This causes significant issues for marine life like causing the bleaching of coral reefs and the overall loss of marine life.</p>
<h4>The Ocean is the Worlds Largest Ecosystem</h4>
<p>It provides more than 50% of the planets oxygen according to the Nation Ocean Service while also regulating climate and weather patterns. Therefore the ocean is absolutely key to life on Earth. We also rely on it massively for transporting goods and tourism industries. Not forgetting the fish we eat provides some of the highest protein in our diets and is extremely healthy. </p>
<p>There are vast amounts of species of marine life such as fish, coral, seaweed, shark, whales and the list goes on we are still discovering new unseen species in the depths of the deepest oceans around the globe.</p>
