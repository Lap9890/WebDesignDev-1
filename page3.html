    <h3>Imagine a world without water</h3>
    <h4>A bleak future...</h4>
    <p>
      Can we imagine our blue Earth without its most abundant element? The ocean
      is the life support of the planet. It provides a massive 3 billion with
      employment. The problems that arise from this issue will affect every
      single living organism on earth. "Every year an estimated 5 to 12 million
      metric tons of plastic enter the ocean" a statistic taken from

      >
      is shocking. Can we imagine that much plastic floating in the air we
      breathe? Its difficult to comprehend the extent of how far we have gone to
      destroy our own planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      We need to ensure our countries stick the UNs goal and targets to minimize
      damage. This should be an issue spoken about daily. You can notice it when
      you got the beach, the amount of rubbish that washes up. An animal has to
      live with that floating beside them and we eat those fish that swim in
      polutted waters and are acidic. Its time we took action now!
