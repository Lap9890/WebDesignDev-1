    <h3>Imagine a world without water</h3>
    <h4>A bleak future...</h4>
    <p>
      Can we imagine our blue Earth without its most abundant element? The ocean is the life support of the planet. It provides a massive 3 billion people with employment. At least half of the Earths oxygen is produced by the ocean! The problems that arise from this issue will affect every single living organism on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every year an estimated 5 to 12 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean" a statistic taken from https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/goal-14-life-below-water/ is shocking. Can we imagine that much plastic floating in the air we breathe? Its difficult to comprehend the extent of how far we have gone to destroy our own planet.

              Marine animals are affected by ocean pollution in many ways. There is plastic of all shapes and sizes in the ocean. Marine animals can get trapped in larger plastics, maybe get tangled in a net or consume microplastics which may contain toxins.

              According to a recent study at Cornell University in New York, most of the surveyed coral reefs had plastic pollution of some kind. This increased the likelihood of coral reefs becoming diseased. Healthy coral reefs typically would have a 4% chance of being diseased while polluted coral reefs had a much higher risk of 80% or more.

              Toxic chemicals can leach from plastics and microplastics polluting the water. This is extremely harmful to oxygen producing bacteria. These bacteria are partially responsible for maintaining oxygen levels in the water which is critical for the entire ecosystem.

      We need to ensure our countries stick the UNs goal and targets to minimize damage. This should be an issue spoken about daily. You can notice it when you got the beach, the amount of rubbish that washes up. An animal has to live with that floating beside them and we eat those fish that swim in polutted waters and are acidic. Its time we took action now!
