  <h1>Life Below Water part 3</h1>
</head>
<h3>Imagine a world without water</h3>
<h4>A bleak future...</h4>
<p>Can we imagine our blue Earth without its most abundant element? The ocean is the life support of the planet. It provides a massive 3 billion with employment. The problems that arise from this issue will affect every single living organism on earth. "Every year an estimated 5 to 12 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean" a statistic taken from https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/goal-14-life-below-water/ is shocking. Can we imagine that much plastic floating in the air we breathe? Its difficult to comprehend the extent of how far we have gone to destroy our own planet. </p>
<p>We need to ensure our countries stick the UNs goal and targets to minimize damage. This should be an issue spoken about daily. You can notice it when you got the beach, the amount of rubbish that washes up. An animal has to live with that floating beside them and we eat those fish that swim in polutted waters and are acidic. Its time we took action now!</p>
