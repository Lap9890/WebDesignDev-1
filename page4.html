    <h3>What can we do?</h3>
    <h4>Change....</h4>
    <p>
      We need to start helping our oceans. We can do this by recycling, cutting
      emissions, moving to green energy and ensuring waste does not enter the
      oceans. Reduce our plastic use, plastic is a very useful human invention
      it can be used for containers, medical equipment, car parts and so much
      more. Yet when it is dumped it washes into the rivers due to its buoyancy
      and floats out to sea where it is eaten by fish and other animals causing
      severe issues this is of course accidental on the fishes behalf but to us
      its not we have a choice. We can reuse the plastic or for better stop
      producing it as to produce it causes massive greenhouse pollution which
      causes acid rain to fall into our oceans. We can use other less harmful
      materials such as bamboo, wood, natural fibre and also bioplastics these
      are all sustainable.

      Start cleaning our beaches, removing harmful debris and materials that
      have washed up disposing of them in the correct manner. This would be a
      great thing to do for school children on summer holidays as part of an
      awareness campaign. We need to get serious about recycling. In Ireland we
      have Return where empty cans and bottles are bought with a 15 or a 25 cent
      charge on top of the cost to incentivise people to return them to their
      local machine for the return of their charge. This is a great initiative
      and it works! We need to hold countries responsible for their actions.
      This is extremely important. The worlds biggest economies are the biggest
      polluters. This needs to change. As you can see from this graph of the
      biggest polluters according to Worldometer
      https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/.
